By selecting a housing, employment, or credit category for your campaign, you certify not to use TikTok to discriminate based on protected characteristics in ads relating to housing, employment, or credit and to adhere to TikTok's special ad category policy . Once you use this field to indicate that your campaign is promoting opportunities in any of the ad categories, the targeting options at the ad group level will be limited to help you comply with anti-discrimination laws in these categories. See Targeting requirements for ad groups in a campaign with special ad categories to learn about the requirements. Enum values: HOUSING : Ads for real estate listings, homeowners insurance, mortgage loans or other related opportunities. EMPLOYMENT : Ads for job offers, internship, professional certification programs or other related opportunities. CREDIT : Ads for credit card offers, auto loans, long-term financing or other related opportunities. Note : Using special ad categories in Shopping Ads with campaign product source as Catalog and in Shopping Ads with campaign product source as non-Catalog are currently separate allowlist-only features. If you would like to access them, please contact your TikTok representative. This field is generally available to advertisers registered in America or Canada. Advertisers who are not registered in America or Canada but want to target these countries with special ad categories need to apply for an additional allowlist. If you have selected special ad categories for a campaign, you can remove the special ad categories, but you cannot change them or enable the special ad categories for an existing campaign if the special ad categories are currently disabled."
