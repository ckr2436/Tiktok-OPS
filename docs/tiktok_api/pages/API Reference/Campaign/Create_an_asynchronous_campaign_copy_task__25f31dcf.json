Max size: 50. See here to learn more about how to create and manage Offline Event sets. Note : Offline Events Tracking is currently an allowlist-only feature. If you would like to access it, please contact your TikTok representative. If you are allowlisted for Offline Events Tracking, then existing auto-tracking Offline Event sets have to be tracked under a newly created ad: You can omit this parameter, then this field will automatically default to the IDs of all the existing auto-tracking Offline Event sets under the advertiser account, or You can manually pass in this parameter. You need to specify via this field at least all the existing auto-tracking Offline Event set IDs, and non-auto-tracking ones are optional. To get the IDs of current auto-tracking Offline Event sets, call /offline/get/ to get all Offline Event set IDs and then select all the auto-tracking ones according to the returned auto_tracking parameter. This field supports the following campaign objectives: TRAFFIC , LEAD_GENERATION , APP_PROMOTION , and WEB_CONVERSIONS ."
