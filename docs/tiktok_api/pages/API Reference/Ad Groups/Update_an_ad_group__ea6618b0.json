AND automatic targeting is NOT used in your ad group(i.e., auto_targeting_enabled is NOT set to true ). Saved Audience ID. Before using this field, call /dmp/saved_audience/create/ to create a Saved Audience and get the Saved Audience ID in response. The advertiser ID associated with your Saved Audience should be the same as the advertiser ID in your ad group. Otherwise, an error will occur. If you use saved_audience_id to create an ad group, we will return both the Saved Audience ID and the targeting options that are included within your Saved Audience in response. See Create a Saved Audience to find out the detailed workflow and code examples. Note : When creating a Saved Audience via /dmp/saved_audience/create/ , you can specify targeting options such as gender . However, if you are creating an ad group using a Saved Audience, you must avoid concurrently setting both the saved_audience_id and targeting options (like gender ) already within your Saved Audience. Otherwise, an error will occur. If the device setting of your Saved Audience is in conflict with the device settings of the ad group, an error will occur. Examples include: When the operating system for your Saved Audience is Android, but while creating an ad group, you set ios14_targeting as IOS14_PLUS . When you specify APP_PROMOTION as the objective_type field at the campaign level and use the App ID of an Android App in your ad group, yet your Saved Audience's operating system is iOS. If your API request throws an error that is associated with a conflict between your Saved Audience configurations and ad group configurations, the current error message will indicate that the issue pertains to your audience targeting option. To resolve this, we recommend using /dmp/saved_audience/list/ to check the details of the corresponding targeting option to identify the source of the problem and then create a new Saved Audience if necessary. If the saved_audience_id was created with age_groups specified, the age restriction rules outlined in New age restrictions for ads on TikTok for different advertising objectives also apply. Make sure that the age targeting setting is allowed before you use the Saved Audience ( saved_audience_id ) in the ad group."
