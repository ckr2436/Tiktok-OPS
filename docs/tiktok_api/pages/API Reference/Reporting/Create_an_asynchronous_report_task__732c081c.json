Note : This field is only valid when report_type is BASIC or AUDIENCE . Starting November 15th, 2024, the translation of certain metrics in the title row of async reports will be updated to provide a better user experience. This change will not affect the metric field names themselves. To minimize potential disruptions, we strongly recommend setting enable_report_title_translation to false in your code. This will eliminate dependencies on metric translations, which are subject to periodic updates. While these translations are provided to help map metrics to their corresponding names in TikTok Ads Manager, relying on them in your code may lead to breaking changes in the future. By disabling title row translation, you can ensure more stable and predictable behavior in your integration."
