Please be aware of the following information when working with this field: When advertiser_ids is used, we will return up to 20,000 IDs in response. The cutoff logic for IDs is based on the creation time of campaigns, ad groups, or ads in descending order, but we cannot guarantee that each advertiser will have an evenly distributed number of IDs. When advertiser_ids is used, the returned metrics data in the response will include currency , timezone , and advertiser_id . Different advertisers might have different time zones. You can use multi_adv_report_in_utc_time to determine whether the data returned should be set to the UTC+0 timezone for all advertisers or set to the local timezone for each respective advertiser. Different advertisers might have different currencies, and we will return the corresponding currency for each advertiser in the returned metrics . These metric data will be presented without a decimal point. For instance, a spend of \"100 USD\" will be displayed as 100 without any decimal indicator such as \".000\". If you want to view the total added-up metrics for all advertiser IDs, enable enable_total_metrics in your request. The returned total_metrics in the response will include currency , timezone , and advertiser_id , but all with a value of - . Note : If you use advertiser_ids but do not include any ID dimensions in the dimensions field, we will return 0 as the value for currency , timezone , and advertiser_id and - as the value of cost-related metrics, such as spend , in the metrics object of the response. The advertisers specified in advertiser_ids should all belong to the same TikTok for Business user. Otherwise, an error will occur. Use /oauth2/advertiser/get/ to retrieve a list of advertiser IDs that belong to the same TikTok for Business user."
