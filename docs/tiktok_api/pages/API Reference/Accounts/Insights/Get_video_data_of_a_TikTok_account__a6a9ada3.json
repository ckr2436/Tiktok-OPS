If you want to request multiple fields, you need to at least include \"item_id\" in the value for fields . Otherwise, an error may occur. Example : [\"item_id\", \"create_time\"] . Note : All video engagement metrics are aggregated over the lifetime of the video. Unlike profile-level metrics, the aggregation is not limited to a 60-day look-back period. To retrieve certain fields in the response, you must have specific permissions. You can check the \"Required permission\" column for each field in the response schema to determine the permissions needed. To confirm that you have the necessary permission scope, you can check the scope returned by the /tt_user/token_info/get/ endpoint. If the required permission has not been granted to you, follow the steps outlined in Authorization to enable the TikTok account user to reauthorize your app with the permission. Supported fields : item_id : Unique identifier for the video. thumbnail_url : Preview thumbnail URL for the video. share_url : A shareable URL for the video. embed_url : An embeddable URL for the video. caption : The caption/description for the video. video_duration : Duration of the video, in seconds. likes : Likes.
