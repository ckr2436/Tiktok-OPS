Example : https://tiktok.com/tiktok-images/image.jpg Important : You cannot publish photo posts using unverified photo URLs. To ensure a smooth API integration, we recommend you verify ownership of URL properties as soon as possible, and specify a URL that has been verified for ownership, either manually or automatically. To manually verify ownership of a URL property, follow the steps outlined in Manage URL properties . Note that if you are a developer or an advertiser who used the /business/video/publish/ endpoint to publish videos prior to April 7th, 2023, we have automatically set the corresponding domains of video URLs specified through the video_url parameter to the \"verified\" status. Therefore, we recommend that you use the /business/property/list/ endpoint to confirm whether the domains you utilize for hosting images have been automatically verified."

You can use \"\\n\" as line break to display the post caption in multiple lines within the mobile TikTok App. However, for the line break to work effectively, the caption must contain enough characters to trigger truncation based on the current mobile phone's display settings and operating system. This truncation is characterized by an ellipsis mark (...) and the word \"more\", which users can click to expand and view the full caption. If the caption is too short and does not trigger truncation, the \"\\n\" character will be ignored, and the caption will be displayed on a single line without any line breaks. Note that in the TikTok Web App \"\\n\" will always be ignored. Example: Me and me casa üè† #cat #kitten #britishshorthair Note : Any hashtags and mentions included in the post caption will render as plain text on the TikTok application."
