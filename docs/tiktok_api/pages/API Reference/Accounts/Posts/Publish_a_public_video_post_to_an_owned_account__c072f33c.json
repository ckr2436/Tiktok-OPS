The minimum video duration must be 3 seconds, and the maximum video duration is 600 seconds. To check the maximum video duration allowed for a TikTok account, use /business/video/settings/ and obtain max_video_post_duration_sec from the response. The minimum height and minimum width of the video must be 360 pixels. The minimum frame rate of the video must be 23 FPS, and maximum frame rate is 60 FPS. Example : https://www.example.com/tiktok-videos/video.mp4 Important : Starting from November 16th, 2023, you can no longer publish videos using unverified video URLs. To ensure a smooth API integration, we recommend you verify ownership of URL properties as soon as possible, and specify a URL that has been verified for ownership, either manually or automatically. To manually verify ownership of a URL property, follow the steps outlined in Manage URL properties . After November 16th, 2023, if you want to publish a test video through /business/video/publish/ using a test video URL that doesn't require verification, use the test URL https://sf16-va.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-va2/uvpapzpbxjH-aulauvJ-WV[[/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/3min.mp4 . Note that if you are a developer or an advertiser who used the /business/video/publish/ endpoint to publish videos prior to April 7th, 2023, we have automatically set the corresponding domains of video URLs specified through the video_url parameter to the \"verified\" status. Therefore, we recommend that you use the /business/property/list/ endpoint to confirm whether the domains you utilize for hosting videos have been automatically verified."
